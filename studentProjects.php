<ol>
  <li>Improved layout of waiting room at VA clinic. How to make it more efficient in use of space.</li>
	<li>Inpatient room alarm system. Installed in new positive air pressure hospital rooms and this project analyzed the failure of warning systems related to room air pressure.</li>
	<li>Floor plan redesign of radiology department. For speeding up visit time and to reduce wait time several analyses were done comparing patient and staff travel time.</li>
	<li>Floor plan redesign of mammography area. To increase throughput alternatives were devised for the flow of work and reengineering of tasks.</li>
	<li>Computer simulation regarding the effect of inpatient discharge time on ED and OR queues. Simulation models assessed the impact of different bed capacity and discharge time.</li>
	<li>Lean study of patient transport processes. Identified what tasks were no longer needed in transporting patients within a hospital.</li>
	<li>Pathology lab flow improvement.</li>
	<li>Real estate study for clinic relocation. Determine best location based on multi attribute comparison.</li>
	<li>Cost effectiveness analysis of new GI equipment. Return on investment.</li>
	<li>Time study of VA clinic to reduce wait time.</li>
	<li>Revenue cycle work flow analysis.</li>
	<li>Analysis to find best location for new outpatient clinic. To accommodate increased volume.</li>
	<li>Nursing home staffing related to quality measures</li>
	<li>Bed turnover time improvement. Workflow redesign.</li>
	<li>Revision to doctor order forms to reduce errors. Redesign forms.</li>
	<li>Radiology film location system. To reduce errors, missing materials.</li>
	<li>Revision to ER triage workflow. Queuing study.</li>
	<li>Study of pharmacy & inpatient discharge orders. To reduce delays for inpatient discharge times.</li>
	<li>Emergency Department Crowding – review of literature related to measuring it. *</li>
	<li>A surgery scheduling simulation model. *</li>
	<li>The hospital discharge process and methods to improve it. *</li>
	<li>Operating room report card designs. *</li>
	<li>Dermatology clinic layout. *</li>
	<li>Review of process improvement literature for surgery. *</li>
	<li>Tracking individual prescriptions for the student health service. *</li>
	<li>Quality vs. cost internationally</li>
	<li>Surgery case study</li>
	<li>Radiology case study</li>
	<li>P4P &amp; its effect</li>
	<li>Use of claims data to improve performance</li>
	<li>Patient discharge process and the flow of information</li>
	<li>Linear Programming model to maximize profit for Digital Mammography</li>
	<li>Creation of Management Engineering website with social networking</li>
	<li>Work related to current research in telemedicine</li>
	<li>Patient visit redesign, with EMR aspect</li>
